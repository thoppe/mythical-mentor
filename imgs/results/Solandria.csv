The world is now a patchwork of shattered continents, floating islands, and archipelagos surrounded by endless oceans. The people of Solandria are resilient and resourceful, and have adapted to their new world through the use of magic and technology.

Magic is a fundamental part of life in Solandria, and is used for everything from transportation to communication. The most powerful magic is wielded by the mage guilds, who use their abilities to shape the world around them and protect their people from the dangers that lurk in the shadows. However, magic is also dangerous and unpredictable, and those who wield it must be careful not to overreach their abilities.

Technology is also prevalent in Solandria, though it is often powered by magic rather than traditional sources such as coal or oil. Airships and steam engines are common, and the people of Solandria have also developed advanced weaponry such as firearms and explosives. However, technology is still relatively primitive compared to modern standards, and much of it is still in its infancy.

The culture of Solandria is diverse and varied, with different regions having their own unique customs and traditions. However, there are some common themes that run throughout the world. Honor and courage are highly valued, and many people are willing to risk everything to protect their families and communities.
