The world is set on a sprawling archipelago, where the skies are constantly lit up by auroras that never fade. These auroras are the source of much of the world's magic and power, and the people who inhabit this world have learned to harness this power in many ways.\n\nThe world is divided into several large regions, each with its own distinct culture and way of life. The geopolitics of the world are complex, with various factions and groups vying for power and control over the different regions. There are powerful kingdoms and empires, as well as smaller independent city-states and freeholds.\n\nMagic is an integral part of life in Aurora Dominion, and it is used in many different ways. Some people use magic to control the weather, creating storms or calm seas as needed. Others use it to heal the sick or injured, while still others use it to create powerful weapons or to enhance their physical abilities.\n\nTechnology is also advanced in Aurora Dominion, with many different forms of transportation available. There are airships that sail through the skies, powered by magic and technology alike.
