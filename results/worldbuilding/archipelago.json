Her skin is a pale shade of blue, and seems to glow softly, even in the dim light of her secluded abode. She moves with a grace and fluidity that is almost ethereal, and her movements are accompanied by the sound of tinkling bells that seem to emanate from nowhere.\n\nShe wears a long, flowing robe made of shimmering fabric that reflects the colors of the auroras in the sky. The fabric seems to shift and change as she moves, creating an ever-changing display of color and light. She also wears a series of intricately woven chains and amulets around her neck, each one studded with precious gems and glittering stones.\n\nThe Oracle's eyes are a deep, penetrating green, and seem to hold a wisdom and knowledge that is beyond the comprehension of mortals. When she speaks, her voice is soft and melodic, carrying a hint of an accent that is impossible to place. Her words are often cryptic and mysterious, leaving those who seek her advice with more questions than answers.\n\nDespite her otherworldly appearance, the Oracle is approachable and welcoming, and is often consulted by the fishermen of Crystal Lake before they set out to sea. She is said to have the power to predict the weather and other natural phenomena, and her advice is highly valued by those who live and work on the lake. However, few have dared to ask her about her other rumored magical abilities, as the Oracle is known to be fiercely protective of her privacy and secrets."
