    "description": "In Clawville, everything is a chicken. From the smallest insect to the largest predator, every creature takes on the form of a chicken. Despite this, the world is devoid of magic and operates on a pre-industrial level of technology. \n\nThe culture of Clawville is heavily influenced by the fact that chickens are the only sentient beings on the planet. There are chickens with jobs, ranging from farmers and craftsmen to merchants and soldiers. These chickens work together to build and maintain their communities, which are often centered around agriculture and trade.\n\nWild chicken creatures roam the lands, with some species being more docile and others being fiercely territorial. These creatures are hunted for food and resources, but also respected for their place in the ecosystem. Domesticated chickens are kept as pets, often bred for their unique colors and patterns.\n\nDespite the lack of magical elements, Clawville has developed a range of technologies to meet the needs of its chicken inhabitants. Simple machines like pulleys and levers are used to aid in construction and transportation. Basic metallurgy and agriculture have been developed to improve the quality of life for chickens.\n\nThe culture of Clawville is heavily influenced by the filmmaker Werner Herzog, who views chickens as unintelligent animals. This has led to a society that values practicality and hard work over creativity and innovation. However, there are some chickens who seek to challenge this worldview and push the boundaries of what is possible in Clawville.",
