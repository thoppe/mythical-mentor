['world_description'],"Aurora Dominion is a world unlike any other, where magic and technology coexist in a delicate balance. The world is set on a sprawling archipelago, where the skies are constantly lit up by auroras that never fade. These auroras are the source of much of the world's magic and power, and the people who inhabit this world have learned to harness this power in many ways.

The world is divided into several large regions, each with its own distinct culture and way of life. The geopolitics of the world are complex, with various factions and groups vying for power and control over the different regions. There are powerful kingdoms and empires, as well as smaller independent city-states and freeholds.

Magic is an integral part of life in Aurora Dominion, and it is used in many different ways. Some people use magic to control the weather, creating storms or calm seas as needed. Others use it to heal the sick or injured, while still others use it to create powerful weapons or to enhance their physical abilities.

Technology is also advanced in Aurora Dominion, with many different forms of transportation available. There are airships that sail through the skies, powered by magic and technology alike. There are also boats and ships that traverse the seas between the different islands, as well as trains and other forms of ground transportation.

Despite the many advancements in magic and technology, there are still many challenges facing the people of Aurora Dominion. There are fanatical religious sects that seek to impose their will on others, and there are powerful gangs and criminal organizations that prey on the weak and vulnerable.

Overall, Aurora Dominion is a world of wonder and danger, where magic and technology combine to create a truly unique and fascinating place.",results/images/Aurora_Dominion/000000.png,False,"((sfw)), easynegative, badhandv4, greyscale, monochrome, water mark, signature, bad anatomy, bad proportions, deformed, poorly drawn hands, extra fingers, extra limbs, blurry","painterly style, flat colours, illustration, bright and colourful, high contrast, Mythology, cinematic, detailed, atmospheric, 8k, corona render"
