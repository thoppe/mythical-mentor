['world_description'],"Henhaven is a world where every creature is a variation of chicken. From the smallest insects to the largest beasts, everything has feathers and a beak. The only exception are the plants, which have adapted to be eaten by chickens.

Technology in Henhaven is limited to pre-industrial levels, with most tasks being done by hand or with simple tools. The most advanced forms of transportation are horse-drawn carts and boats propelled by oars. There is no magic in Henhaven, so all advancements must be made through ingenuity and hard work.

The culture in Henhaven revolves around the various jobs that chickens have. There are farmers who tend to the crops and raise the livestock, blacksmiths who craft tools and weapons, and even artists who create works of art using chicken feathers and eggs. Due to their lack of intelligence, chickens are often supervised by more intelligent creatures, such as turkeys and ducks.

Wild chicken creatures roam the forests and plains of Henhaven. These creatures range from small, timid birds to large, fierce predators. The most dangerous of these creatures are the raptor chickens, which are known for their razor-sharp talons and keen eyesight.

Cute chicken pets are common in Henhaven, with many households keeping chickens as companions. These pets are often pampered and treated like members of the family, with their eggs being a valuable source of food.

Overall, Henhaven is a world of simplicity and hard work, where chickens are the center of everything. Despite their limitations, the chickens of Henhaven have built a thriving society through their determination and resourcefulness.",results/images/Henhaven/000000.png,False,"((sfw)), (people:1.1), (human:1.1), easynegative, badhandv4, greyscale, monochrome, water mark, signature, bad anatomy, bad proportions, deformed, poorly drawn hands, extra fingers, extra limbs, blurry","(Chicken:1.1).
