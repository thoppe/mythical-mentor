The city was founded by a group of Aelvari and Drogath who had been forced to flee their homes during the great sundering. These two races had been bitter enemies for centuries, but during their time of need, they learned to coexist and work together for the greater good. Over time, the city grew and prospered, becoming a hub of trade and commerce in the frozen north.

The city is built around a massive central plaza, which is surrounded by towering buildings made of ice and stone. Many of these buildings are adorned with intricate carvings and mosaics, depicting scenes from the city's history and mythology. The plaza itself is home to many street performers, artists, and vendors, who sell everything from fresh seafood to exotic spices and rare magical artifacts.

Despite being built on the edge of a frozen wasteland, Arkturia is a center of art and culture. The city is home to many great artists, poets, and musicians, who draw inspiration from the city's icy landscape and rich history. The city also boasts several museums and galleries, which showcase the works of both local and foreign artists.

One of the most notable events in Arkturia's history was the Great Frost Festival. This festival is held every winter, and it marks the end of the longest night of the year. During the festival, the city is transformed into a magical wonderland, with ice sculptures, fireworks, and performances by some of the city's most talented artists and musicians.

Arkturia is a city of contrasts, with the elegant architecture of the Aelvari contrasting with the rough and rugged style of the Drogath.

Her eyes are a deep shade of blue, with a hint of silver around the edges, and seem to hold a deep and ancient wisdom.

Lyra is dressed in flowing robes of blue and silver, adorned with delicate embroidery and intricate patterns. Her lute, a beautiful instrument crafted from silver and ivory, is always close at hand, and she seems to be lost in thought as she strums the strings.

As she begins to sing, her voice fills the air, a hauntingly beautiful melody that seems to echo through the very soul. Her music is infused with magic, and as she weaves her spells, the very air around her seems to shimmer and dance with light.

Her audience is usually captivated by her performance, their eyes fixed on her as she sings. Some of them close their eyes, swaying to the music, while others seem to be lost in a trance. Even the most savage of beasts seem to be tamed by her music, their eyes softening as they listen to her voice.

Lyra seems to be lost in her own world as she sings, her fingers moving expertly over the strings of her lute. Her face is serene, her eyes closed, as if she is communing with some otherworldly force. It's as if she is a vessel for the music, a conduit for the magic that flows through her.

It is home to a mixture of Drogath and Quilith, who work together to extract valuable minerals and gems from the earth. The town is situated in a narrow valley, with steep cliffs rising up on either side. The only way in or out is through a narrow pass that is heavily guarded, as the area is often under threat from bandits and other raiders.

Ironhold was founded shortly after the great sundering, when a group of Drogath miners discovered a rich vein of ore in the side of the cliff. They quickly set up a mining operation, digging deep into the earth to extract the valuable minerals and gems. Over time, the town grew, with more miners and their families moving in to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the rich veins of ore.

Despite the dangers of the area, Ironhold has managed to survive and thrive over the years, thanks to the hard work and determination of its inhabitants. The town is known for its skilled miners, who are able to extract the valuable minerals and gems from the earth with great precision and care. They are also skilled at working with metals, and are able to create beautiful and intricate jewelry and other ornamental objects.

The town is known for its impressive sculptures and carvings, many of which are made from the same materials that are extracted from the earth. The miners also have a tradition of storytelling, often gathering around the fire at night to share tales of their exploits and adventures.

Despite its relative isolation, Ironhold is not without its major events. The town celebrates a number of festivals throughout the year, many of which are centered around the mining industry. One of the most important is the Festival of the Vein, which celebrates the discovery of the original vein of ore that led to the founding of the town. During the festival, the miners hold a parade through the town, displaying their skills and their wares for all to see.
