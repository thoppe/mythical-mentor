['world_description'],"Sapphira is a world where magic and mysticism are as commonplace as the air people breathe. The world is populated by bellydancing Amazonian queens who practice polyamory and worship Athena, the goddess of wisdom, courage, and justice. The society is matriarchal and the women are the leaders. They value intelligence, creativity, and compassion above all else.

The technology in Sapphira is preindustrial, with most people living in small, close-knit communities. The people use hand tools and simple machines to farm the land and craft their goods. They also have access to basic medical knowledge and herbal remedies to treat illnesses.

Magic is an integral part of life in Sapphira. The women of the temple are trained in the art of magic and use it to heal the sick, protect their people, and communicate with the gods. They are also able to use magic to enhance their dancing and create breathtaking performances.

The culture in Sapphira is one of love, respect, and equality. The women are free to love who they choose and are adored by men who appreciate them for their whole person. Polyamory is accepted and even encouraged, as it allows for deeper connections and greater emotional fulfillment.

Outside the temple, the other cities are falling to the encroaching barbarian hordes governed by the patriarchal system. The women of Sapphira are determined to resist this oppressive system and create a more just society. They are fierce warriors and skilled strategists, and will do whatever it takes to protect their people and preserve their way of life.

Overall, Sapphira is a world of beauty, magic, and love, but also one of struggle and conflict as the matriarchal society clashes with the patriarchal invaders. It is a world where the power of love and the strength of women are the keys to survival.",results/images/Sapphira/000000.png,False,"easynegative, badhandv4, greyscale, monochrome, water mark, signature, bad anatomy, bad proportions, deformed, poorly drawn hands, extra fingers, extra limbs, blurry","Illustration by Zindy S.
